# Python_End-to-end_Multiclass_Classification_Project

In this project, I analyzed the data using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques, built a machine learning model with an f1_score of 88% on the test dataset, and developed a web application using the Streamlit library

You may take a look to the application in the following link.

All the materials are from the campaign which is created by StackUp and collaborated with Avikumar Talaviya.
